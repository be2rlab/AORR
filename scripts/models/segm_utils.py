    Args:
        masks (Tensor): N, 1, H, W
        boxes (Tensor): N, 4
        img_h (int): Height of the image to be pasted.
        img_w (int): Width of the image to be pasted.
        skip_empty (bool): Only paste masks within the region that
            tightly bound all boxes, and returns the results this region only.
            An important optimization for CPU.

    Returns:
        tuple: (Tensor, tuple). The first item is mask tensor, the second one
            is the slice object.
        If skip_empty == False, the whole image will be pasted. It will
            return a mask of shape (N, img_h, img_w) and an empty tuple.
        If skip_empty == True, only area around the mask will be pasted.
            A mask of shape (N, h', w') and its start and end coordinates
            in the original image will be returned.
